Google Pacman
-------------

This is a copy of Google's playable Pacman game logo hosted for
Pacman's 30th Anniversary.

With the help of StackOverflow users, we were able to get a playable
version working 100%.

To play a live version: https://vocalnutria9174.github.io/gpacman

Or download the source and run it offline.


(there is sadly no sound =()
